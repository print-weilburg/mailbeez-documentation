![](http://www.mailbeez.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/been_tutorial.png "been_tutorial")Coupons will help you to grow your revenue coming from your customer base – but they normally take a lot of time to run them manually.

Since you would like to track what coupons were send out and used, you need some kind of intelligent system, which finds your customers and generate automatically personalized individual coupons. That is possible with MailBeez.

Following a Tutorial for how to construct and automate coupon campaigns based on different triggers (customer behaviours) .

When designing your Coupon Campaign you need to take in consideration how to make them most efficient without risking to lose control:

## 1. The Importance of a Coupon Expiration Date

![](http://www.mailbeez.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/notification_done_big.png "notification_done_big")With an expiration date you create a sense of **urgency**. If an expiration date is months away, the consumer is more likely forget about it. By using an expiration date of **less than thirty days**, the consumer is more likely to use the coupon.

The MailBeez Coupon Modules allows you to generate Coupon Codes with a dynamic Expiration Date. So you can configure that the send out, individual Coupon is only valid for lets say 14 days from the point of time it was sent out – fully automatically!

## 2. The Importance of individual Coupons

![](http://www.mailbeez.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/notification_done_big.png "notification_done_big")When handing out online coupon codes you must be prepared for a viral effect. Coupon codes often gets posted on popular forums, which can cause you more new orders than you may be able to fulfill – or which might make you loose even money if your coupon campaign is giving too much discount.

The MailBeez Coupon Modules will generate individual Coupon Codes per Customer, so you can control how often that coupon code can be used! Since the Coupons sent out are also tracked, you will be able to identify where a new order is coming from or you can even remind Customers about their coupon code is going to expire – which will againg create a sense of urgency.

With MailBeez Coupon Modules you will get full controll over your coupon campaigns and be able to automate them!

# Step 1: Choose your Coupon Campaigns

With MailBeez you can automize your Coupon Campaigns. As the first Step you need to plan what kind of coupons you would like to send out.  
 What kind of coupons you send out and in which time-steps is highly depended from the products you are selling and in which market. You might take a look at your competition and do some research what is working and what not.

## Reorder Coupon

Send your customers a coupon for the next order, e.g.

> “10% off for your next order within the next 2 weeks!”

This type of coupon is perfect for products where customers can by addons, upgrades, additional products etc. You can utilize the positive “buying” attitude of a customer who just ordered, got excited about your products and is therefore likely to buy more.

## Review Coupon

saying thank you for a review is a good thing and might even help you to collect more reviews.

> “We would like to thank you for your Review with a Coupon for free shipping”

Reviews are an important tool to increase revenue sine customers are more likely to buy when they read positive recommendations of others. Even nagative reviews might work – when the store owner is repsonding to it in a caring manner like “we have changed this in the current shipped products”.  So why not rewarding your customers writing a review for you?

## Winback Coupon

Worried about losing your customers? Bring your shop back into the mind of your customers by sending them a “Winback”-Coupon for easy customer reactivation.

Set up e.g. “6 months after the laster order” to send out a coupon

> “We are missing you! Order within the next 10days and get 10% discount.”

together with some special offers a powerful tool.

## Birthday Coupon

Your customers Birthday is the perfect opportunity to contact them with a special offer, what about this:

> “Happy Birthday! We appreciate you as our customer – enjoy 15% discount within the next 3 days”

I would like to get that kind of coupons ![;-)](http://localhost/wordpress_mailbeez_EOL/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif)

## Coupon Campaign

Perfect for season-greetings where you want to send out a coupon to all customers, e.g. for Christmas, Valintines day etc.

> “5% off for all early-bird christmas orders before 10th of december”.

With sending coupons through the MailBeez-Module you are in full control how often each coupon can be used, you know who received that coupon and you can remind customers about the expiry of their unused coupon.

This Module is typically used manually.

## Coupon Expiry Reminder

Why not remind your customers when their coupon is expiring? Since all Coupons send through MailBeez Coupon Modules are tracked, you are able to follow-up on them and remind your customers e.g. 3 days before the coupon is going to expire.

> “Your coupon will expire in 3 days”

This will lead to more usage of the coupons since you build up a compelling event to buy now and not wait any longer.

So take a piece of paper and write down which coupons you would like to send out.

For each coupon campaign you need to define:

- kind of discount (% or absolute / free shipping)
- minimum order volume before the coupon can be used
- Number of Usage per coupon or per customer

# Step 2: Setting up Coupons

Go to your coupon admin and set up individual coupons for each campaign.

Reorder Coupon
