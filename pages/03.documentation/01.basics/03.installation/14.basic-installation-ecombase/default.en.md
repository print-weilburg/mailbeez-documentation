The Installation of MailBeez 2.5 is successfully tested with *ECB* 1.08, running on PHP 5.2.11

The installation is straight forward and can be done in a couple of minutes by following these steps:

- copy new files
- add permission (half automatic)
- Install MailBeez

MailBeez is maintaining it’s own tables – the shops existing table stay as they are.

## Step 1 – copy new files

copy following file to your admin-directory

```
mailbeez.php
```


copy following file and folder to your catalog-directory (where your index.php is located)

```
mailhive (folder)
mailhive.php
```


## Step 2 – modify existing files

### 1. Add a menu entry

located and open the file

```
admin/includes/header.php
```


find

```
BOX_RSS => array('acl' => true,
                 'link' => array(FILENAME_CONFIGURATION, 'gID=27'),
                 'icon' => 'icon_rss.png'),
```

add after

```
'MailBeez' => array('acl' => true,
                    'link' => 'mailbeez.php',
                    'icon' => '../../../mailhive/common/images/minibeez.png'),
```


this will add the menu-entry “MailBeez” to your Tools-Box. Feel free to place this link whereever you want.

## Step 3 – add permission

run

```
(shop)/mailhive.php
```


this will add the required permission for MailBeez for the primary admin account.
If necessary add admin permission for MailBeez for secondary admin accounts as well
