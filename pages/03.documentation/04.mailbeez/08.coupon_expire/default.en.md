**Customer not used a store issued coupon yet? Never fear! Send them an automated coupon expiry reminder email with this handy Mailbeez module.**

As we’re sure you know, whilst email has the highest Return on Investment of any eCommerce marketing strategy, your customer’s inbox is a seriously busy place. Therefore, if you want to maximize the opportunity for your coupon campaign to be viewed and used, it is a good idea to send them a timely coupon expiry reminder email; which is the reason this little Mailbeez module exists.

**Automated and intelligent**

Like all Mailbeez modules, the Coupon Expiry Reminder bolt-on is fully automated, and once installed and styled, is a fit and forget addition that simply checks for any coupons that have not been used and that will expire in the configured time frame, and emails the qualifying customers accordingly.

Mailbeez of course is one intelligent email system, so in case you are concerned that older customers with invalid coupons will be sent reminders, then you can rest easy; Mailbeez will only email customers with a valid coupon.

**Template based for ease of deployment**

Like all MailBeez Modules the email content is taken from a template, which is very easy to customize to match the style and branding of your store.

**Want responsive Emails with MailBeez?**  
![](http://www.mailbeez.com/images/responsive.png) ([what are responsive emails?](/documentation/responsive-emails/)) In combination with the [responsive template manager](/documentation/mailbeez/config_tmplmngr) you are able to select a responsive email template for this module and adopt it to your design.   
The shown themed email templates are not yet responsive, we plan to make that as soon as possible (support for responsive emails will require in any case the [responsive template manager](/documentation/mailbeez/config_tmplmngr)). ****

 

**Configuration settings**

Every Mailbeez module offers deceptively simple configuration options, and the Coupon Reminder module offers two distinct settings:

- **Set minimum days left before expiry (A) ** Sets the minimum number of days before the coupon expires
- **Set maximum days left before expiry (B) **Sets the maximum number of days before the coupon expires

**Here’s a real world example:**

A is set to 5, B is set to 7

Based on these settings, the reminder email will be sent to customers who have received a coupon which has between 7 and 5 days left before it expires.
