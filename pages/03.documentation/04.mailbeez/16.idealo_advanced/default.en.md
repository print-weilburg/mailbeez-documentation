# Advanced Features

this advanced module gives you a couple of settings to streamline and improve your process of inviting customers to give a rating on Idealo:

## multiple order status

Do you have different order status marking orders as shipped! No problem, just check all orders status you want the module to react on

## recognition of regular customers

Don't want to bother your regular customers with an Email to rate on Idealo? Simply define a delay (e.g. 120 days) between to invites and your are done. The module will check when the last invite was sent and decides whether to wait or to send a new rating invite.

## responsive email template

the emails are shown perfectly also on mobile deviced

### Want to integrated your valuable ratings with your Store and Email Marketing?

Using the [Idealo Integration Suite](/documentation/configbeez/config_idealo_rss_importer/) you can easily integrate your Idealo-Ratings with your Store - in a way that makes this "unique fresh content" visible to search engines - and your MailBeez generated Email Marketing emails!
